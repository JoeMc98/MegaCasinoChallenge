<h2>Mega Casino Challenge</h2>
<p>This was an exercise with C# where I created a slot machine that starts the user with $100 and allows him to bet any amount
between $1 and his current worth. There are various winning combinations. One of the requirements was that I had to keep each 
function to a maximum of 6 lines of code.</p>
